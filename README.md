The files aren't actually dots...

# Working Out the Kinks

The basis of a lot of these is the excellent [dkarter](https://github.com/dkarter/dotfiles).

Please don't even begin to base anything off of my work.

## TODO

- How do I test tings?
- Is there a way to set up sessions easily? Like, I want to just call `foo`
  where `foo` is some predefined session and have it load.
- I want to be able to deal with environments in a clean way. It'd be super cool
  to have a set of files that I could have sourced automatically when setting up
  tmux sessions. This could be related to the above `foo` call, where whatever I
  do there looks for an env file? Hmmm...
